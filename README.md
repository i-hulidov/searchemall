## Description
The main limitation of pokeapi is that it only allows to search a single pokemon by its full name. 
To work around this limitation this app pre-downloads all the pokemons. Then it's possible to filter out and display pokemons which names contain search query from the input field. For example, the results of query pid would include pidgey and pidgeot.

The app consists of three screens:
1) The Welcome screen
2) The Home screen with input field and the list of pokemons;
3) The Details screen with the additional information about the selected pokemon;
